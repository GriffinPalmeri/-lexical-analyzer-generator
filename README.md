A Python 3 program (in a file named lexer.py)
that defines a class named Lex that implements a basic lexical analyzer generator.
The constructor for this class takes as its parameters the name of a file containing
specifications of a set of token types (as defined by regular expressions), and the name
of a source text file from which your lexical analyzer will scan and return tokens (as
defined by the token file). The only other method of the Lex class is one called
next_token that scans and returns the next token in the source file.
